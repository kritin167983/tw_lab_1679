## Headings and Styling

### Subheading 1: Text Styling

**Bold** text is great for emphasis. You can also use *italic* text for additional nuance. Combining them gives you **_bold italic_**.

#### Subheading 2: Smaller Section

You can create as many headings as needed to organize your content. Markdown uses `#` for headings with the number of `#` symbols representing the heading level (e.g., `##` for level 2, `###` for level 3, etc.).

## Tables



| Dependency   | Version | Description              |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------|
| Node.js      | 16.x    | JavaScript runtime       |
| Express      | 4.17.1  | Web framework for Node.js|

## Mathematical Expressions
###  **General Form of a Line**


$$
y = mx + b
$$

### **Binomial Theorem**

The binomial theorem expands \( (x + y)^n \) as:

$$
(x + y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k
$$
